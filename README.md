# Gira-LogicNodes

Libraries of Logic Nodes for GIRA X1:
- **CounterIncDec**: Increment/Decrement (or set) a value with user-defined minimum/maximum range and step. Used to control ventilation level from push buttons (+/-) as well as a value transmitter within Gira Smart Home App.

A logic node can directly be imported within GIRA Project Assistant (GPA) from the Logic Editor->Add logic nodes by selecting the zip file in the supplied Zip directory.

Logic node can also be re-build within Visual Studio; you will have to download [GIRA Logic Node SDK](https://link.gira.de/LogicNodeSDKneu) and request a certificate from GIRA to allow usage of self-developed logic nodes on a real X1 device.
